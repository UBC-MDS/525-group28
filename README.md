# Daily Rainfall Prediction in Australia

Contributors: Kingslin Lv, Amir Abbas Shojakhani, and Sufang Tan

This GitHub Repository is our data analysis project for the 2021-22 UBC MDS DSCI 541 course.
## Overview 

The goal of this project is working on a team project involving big data; we will build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~12 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

In Milestone 1, we will explore different methods to load, save and transform large datasets. A Jupyter notebook exploring loading and storing a large dataset in memory directly can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525-group28/blob/main/notebooks/milestone1.ipynb)
## Data

The complete daily rainfall dataset used in our prediction can be downloaded in [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
